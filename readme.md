### a little bit about me:

- **Elías David Galeano 👨‍💻**: Date of birth: 09/04/1992, in the city of Avellaneda - Buenos Aires, Argentina; I am 29 years old, currently I am a self-taught in programming and I enter this world completely unknown to me in search of new challenges since I like to analyze things in a comprehensive way and that is why I am dedicated to full-stack development.

- **Currently 👷‍♀️**: I am not currently working in the IT world, even so, I am currently working, but I am actively seeking my job insertion in the IT world. However, if I am in training in a self-taught way with platforms such as udemy, you tube and also I train in a virtual way in a bootcamp in the "Fundacion Formar" which trains me in full-stack web development with node.

- **I am currently studying 🤓**: As I have already mentioned, I find myself studying self-taught in two different platforms and in a bootcamp and it is one of my priorities to be able to study at the university as far as I can the career of "systems analyst" or "cybersecurity" since today in day for personal reasons I can not do carry out such studies but they are on my list of priorities.

- **I am looking to collaborate on 👯**: Small large-scale projects to gain more experience either with companies or freelancers training, jr, etc.

- **Ask me about 💬**: Express, nodeJs, javascript, html, css, scrum, GIT, github.
